    "## Scraping the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Since song titles on Billboard's 'The Hot 100' have horrible naming schemes, which differs a lot from one song to another, some preprocessing need to take place. An example of this, is the artist *Earth, Wind \\& Fire with The Emotions* which actually denotes *Earth, Wind \\& Fire* featuring *The Emotions*. When searching for songs on the Genius website, the best result achieved when searching for both the song title and artists, as many songs share titles. The problem comes when we search for *Boogie Wonderland* by *Earth, Wind \\& Fire with The Emotions* using the Genius API, since this won't return any song.\n",
    "\n",
    "When searching for songs using the Genius API, we used a sequential searching strategy. This means that we would first search for the song title and full artist name and if that does not yield any results, we first split the artist name at *'feature'*, *'feat.'*, *'ft.'* or *'with'* and then search for the song title and the first partition of the artists name query. If this still doesn't result in any valid song, we remove parentheses from the artist names and replace *'and'* with *'&'*, after which we again search for the song title and artists name. If this fails as well, we try splitting the modified artist names at *'&'* and *','* and search again. If none of these steps result in a valid song, we simply search for the song title and hope for the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "Immediately after loading a song, we make sure it is actually a song. To do this, we filter out songs with specific genres/tags, as Genius also house texts which are not song lyrics. We therefore used the following list of bad genres to avoid those; `['track\\\\s?list', 'album art(work)?', 'liner notes', 'booklet', 'credits', 'interview', 'skit', 'instrumental', 'setlist', 'non-music', 'literature']`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last step before all the raw data was gathered, was to separate all artists for each song. This was done using regex to find and split artists at *','*, *'and'*, *'featuring'* and so on. This results in the artists *Megan Thee Stallion & Dua Lipa* for the song *Sweetest Pie* to be changed to `[Megan Thee Stallion, Dua Lipa]` and the artists *Lil Durk Featuring Gunna* for the song *What Happened To Virgil* to be changed to `[Lil Durk, Gunna]`. However, a negative side effect of this processing is, that artists like the previously mentioned *Earth, Wind & Fire* was changed to `[Earth, Wind, Fire]`. This was a necessary part of the preprocessing and these kinds of artists were regrouped later in the data cleaning."

    "Afterwards, we made a decision to remove all songs where the lyrics were longer than 10,000 characters. This was done because, in spite of all the aforementioned approaches to clean the data, e.g. entire book chapters by the French novelist [Marcel Proust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust) were still present in the dataset because they were labelled with the genre *rap*. The cut-off at 10,000 were chosen based on the fact that all songs we investigated that were longer, were songs that we clearly loaded in wrong. In addition to this, the 6-minute-long song *Rap God* by *Eminem*, where he flexes his ability to rap fast, contains 7,984 characters.\n",

    "While doing a finer combing of the data, we also produced a blacklist for artists that we deemed unwanted in the data set. This list includes *Glee Cast* as they were present in over 200 songs, even though their songs are covers of other popular songs. The full list is seen here `['highest to lowest', 'marcel proust', 'watsky', 'glee cast', 'harttsick', 'eric the red', 'fabvl', 'c-mob']`."

To mitigate this problem, we first calculated how many times each artist appeared in the data set and afterwards, for each artist, how many times they apperead with collaborating artists. Having known these values, we could then for each artist check which other artists they have collaborated with on all of their songs. Artists found using this method were then joined with an underscore, such that `['earth', 'wind', 'fire']` became `['earth_fire_wind']`."
