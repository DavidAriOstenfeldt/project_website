    "\n",
    "We wanted to provide some insight into how artists collaborate, which genres and artists collaborate more and how the language between genres and artists differs. Furthermore, by providing the data set for the user, we also let them play around with it on their own, to investigate further genres, or e.g. looking at how a specific artist has developed through the years."

    "When searching for songs using the Genius API, we used a sequential searching strategy. This means that we would first search for the song title and full artist name and if that does not yield any results, we first split the artist name at *'feature'*, *'feat.'*, *'ft.'* or *'with'* and then search for the song title and the first partition of the artists name query. If this still doesn't result in any valid song, we remove parentheses from the artist names and replace *'and'* with *'&'*, after which we again search for the song title and artists name. If this fails as well, we try splitting the modified artist names at *'&'* and *','* and search again. If none of these steps result in a valid song, we simply search for the song title and hope for the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "Immediately after loading a song, we make sure it is actually a song. To do this, we filter out songs with specific genres/tags, as Genius also house texts which are not song lyrics. We therefore used the following list of bad genres to avoid those; `['track\\\\s?list', 'album art(work)?', 'liner notes', 'booklet', 'credits', 'interview', 'skit', 'instrumental', 'setlist', 'non-music', 'literature']`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last step before all the raw data was gathered, was to separate all artists for each song. This was done using regex to find and split artists at *','*, *'and'*, *'featuring'* and so on. This results in the artists *Megan Thee Stallion & Dua Lipa* for the song *Sweetest Pie* to be changed to `[Megan Thee Stallion, Dua Lipa]` and the artists *Lil Durk Featuring Gunna* for the song *What Happened To Virgil* to be changed to `[Lil Durk, Gunna]`. However, a negative side effect of this processing is, that artists like the previously mentioned *Earth, Wind & Fire* was changed to `[Earth, Wind, Fire]`. This was a necessary part of the preprocessing and these kinds of artists were regrouped later in the data cleaning."

    "Afterwards, we made a decision to remove all songs where the lyrics were longer than 10,000 characters. This was done because, in spite of all the aforementioned approaches to clean the data, e.g. entire book chapters by the French novelist [Marcel Proust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust) were still present in the dataset because they were labelled with the genre *rap*. The cut-off at 10,000 were chosen based on the fact that all songs we investigated that were longer, were songs that we clearly loaded in wrong. In addition to this, the 6-minute-long song *Rap God* by *Eminem*, where he flexes his ability to rap fast, contains 7,984 characters."
