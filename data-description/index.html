Here, we collected song titles and artist names of all songs that appeared on the list starting from the first week of 1960, all the way to today. This was done with the <a href=https://github.com/guoguo12/billboard-charts>billboard.py API</a>. We made sure to only collect the songs if it was either the first time they appeared on the chart, or if we hadn&rsquo;t already added them to the list. This way we collected a total of 29,128 unique songs, out of the total possible 322,400 songs (5,200 a year * 62 years), which means 293,272 songs had multiple appearances on the Billboard &lsquo;Hot-100&rsquo; list.</p><p><img src=../images/billboard_py.png alt></p><p>We used the songs from this list to limit our scope, as otherwise the amount of data we would have to download would be insurmountable. This of course means that the data set does not provide a full picture of the entire network and vocabulary of artists, but as the data is collected from the most popular songs each week, we believe it to be a sufficient representation of the general trends in artists and lyrics through the years. We used the list of artists and song titles to collect lyrics, release year, collaborations, genres and titles from <a href=https://genius.com/Rick-astley-never-gonna-give-you-up-lyrics>genius.com</a>. For this part the <a href=https://lyricsgenius.readthedocs.io/en/master/>LyricsGenius API</a> was used, which is an extension of the <a href=https://docs.genius.com/>base genius API</a> that also collects the lyrics from each song via the python module <a href=https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/>Beautiful Soup</a>. However, the LyricsGenius API does not collect the genres of the songs (known as tags on the genius website), thus we had to modify the code to allow us to collect genres as well:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-Python data-lang=Python><span style=color:#66d9ef>def</span> <span style=color:#a6e22e>SomeShit</span>(some, shit):
  <span style=color:#66d9ef>return</span> some <span style=color:#f92672>+=</span> shit
</code></pre></div><h2 id=avoiding-incorrect-songs>Avoiding incorrect songs</h2><p>Since song titles on Billboard&rsquo;s &lsquo;The Hot 100&rsquo; have horrible naming schemes, which differs a lot from one song to another, some preprocessing need to take place. An example of this, is the artist <em>Earth, Wind & Fire with The Emotions</em> which actually denotes <em>Earth, Wind & Fire</em> featuring <em>The Emotions</em>. When searching for songs on the Genius website, the best result achieved when searching for both the song title and artists, as many songs share titles. The problem comes when we search for <em>Boogie Wonderland</em> by <em>Earth, Wind & Fire with The Emotions</em> using the Genius API, since this wont return any song.</p><p>When searching for songs using the Genius API, we used a sequential searching strategy. This means that we would first search for the song title and full artist name and if that does not yield any results, we first split the artist name at <em>&lsquo;feature&rsquo;</em>, <em>&lsquo;feat.'</em>, <em>&lsquo;ft.'</em> or <em>&lsquo;with&rsquo;</em> and then search for the song title and the first partition of the artists name query. If this still doesn&rsquo;t result in any valid song, we remove parentheses from the artist names and replace <em>&lsquo;and&rsquo;</em> with <em>'&'</em>, after which we again search for the song title and artists name. If this fails as well, we try splitting the modified artist names at <em>'&'</em> and <em>&rsquo;,'</em> and search again. If none of these steps result in a valid song, we simply search for the song title and hope for the best.</p><h2 id=filtering-out-bad-genres-and-separating-artists>Filtering out bad genres and separating artists</h2><p>Immediately after loading a song, we make sure it is actually a song. To do this, we filter out songs with specific genres/tags, as Genius also house texts which are not song lyrics. We therefore used the following list of bad genres to avoid those; <code>['track\\s?list', 'album art(work)?', 'liner notes', 'booklet', 'credits', 'interview', 'skit', 'instrumental', 'setlist', 'non-music', 'literature']</code>.</p><p>The last step before all the raw data was gathered, was to separate all artists for each song. This was done using regex to find and split artists at <em>&rsquo;,'</em>, <em>&lsquo;and&rsquo;</em>, <em>&lsquo;featuring&rsquo;</em> and so on. This results in the artists <em>Megan Thee Stallion & Dua Lipa</em> for the song <em>Sweetest Pie</em> to be changed to <code>[Megan Thee Stallion, Dua Lipa]</code> and the artists <em>Lil Durk Featuring Gunna</em> for the song <em>What Happened To Virgil</em> to be changed to <code>[Lil Durk, Gunna]</code>. However, a negative side effect of this processing is, that artists like the previously mentioned <em>Earth, Wind & Fire</em> was changed to <code>[Earth, Wind, Fire]</code>. This was a necesary part of the preprocessing and these kinds of artists were regrouped later in the data cleaning.</p><p>This way, when collecting data for each song through the modified LyricsGenius API, we would retrieve five attributes: date of release, artists who collaborated on the song, lyrics, genres and the song title. The data looks as follows:</p><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:right>released</th><th style=text-align:right>artists</th><th style=text-align:right>lyrics</th><th style=text-align:right>genres</th><th style=text-align:right>title</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:right>1957</td><td style=text-align:right>[marty robbins]</td><td style=text-align:right>El Paso Lyrics\nOut in the West Texas town of &mldr;</td><td style=text-align:right>[country]</td><td style=text-align:right>El Paso</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:right>1960-01-04</td><td style=text-align:right>[frankie avalon]</td><td style=text-align:right>Why Lyrics I&rsquo;ll never let you go\nWhy?

Next up, duplicates were removed and songs which were not in english were removed by doing a language detection with the Python module <code>langdetect</code>.</p><p>As can be seen in the table above, each of the songs' lyric&rsquo;s begins with the title of the song and <em>&lsquo;Lyrics&rsquo;</em>. This was also removed, as it wasn&rsquo;t part of the actually lyrics, but rather an artifact from gathering the song info using the Genius API.</p><h3 id=removing-long-songs>Removing long songs</h3><p>Afterwards, we made a decision to remove all songs where the lyrics were longer that 10,000 characters. This was done because, in spite of all the aforementioned approaches to clean the data, e.g. entire book chapters by the French novelist <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust>Marcel Proust</a> were still present in the dataset because they were labelled with the genre <em>rap</em>. The cut-off at 10,000 were chosen based on the fact that all songs we investigated that were longer, were songs that we clearly loaded in wrong. In addition to this, the 6 minute long song <em>Rap God</em> by <em>Eminem</em>, where he flexes his ability to rap fast, contains 7,984 characters.</p><p>The full distribution of the song lengths can be seen in the figure below:
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><h3 id=blacklist>Blacklist</h3><p>While doing a finer combing of the data, we also produced a blacklist for artists that we deemed unwanted in the data set. This list includes <em>Glee Cast</em> as they were present in over 200 songs, even though their songs are covers of other popular songs. The full list is seen here <code>['highest to lowest', 'marcel proust', 'watsky', 'glee cast', 'harttsick', 'eric the red', 'fabvl', 'c-mob']</code>.</p><h3 id=regrouping-artists>Regrouping artists</h3><p>As mentioned earlier, after gathering the data, we had to separate all artists to work with them properly, though in some cases, this results in one artist being split up into multiple - as was the case with <em>Earth, Wind & Fire</em>. To mitigate this problem, we first calculated how many times each artist appeared in the data set and afterwards, for each artist, how many times they apperead with collaborating artists. Having known these values, we could then for each artist check which other artists they have collaborated with on all of their songs. Artists found using this method were then joined with an underscore, such that <code>['earth', 'wind', 'fire']</code> became <code>['earth_fire_wind']</code>.</p><h1 id=properties-of-the-data>Properties of the data</h1><p>After doing all data processing and cleaning, the final data set is comprised of 25,419 songs and 7,855 unique artists.
