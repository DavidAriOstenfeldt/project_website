Here, we collected song titles and artist names of all songs that appeared on the list starting from the first week of 1960, all the way to today. This was done with the billboard.py API. We made sure to only collect the songs if it was either the first time they appeared on the chart, or if we hadn&amp;rsquo;t already added them to the list.</description></item><item><title>Network analysis</title><link>https://davidariostenfeldt.github.io/project_website/network-analysis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidariostenfeldt.github.io/project_website/network-analysis/</guid><description>This section will cover the collaboration between artists aspect of the project.

There is a lot to analyse which is why the page is divided into 3 separate sections. The first section goes over differences and similarities between genres. Next comes a section exposing the trends of each decade, and lastly, the reader is invited on a deep dive into the linguistic proficiency of the most successful artist in modern times.</description></item></channel></rss>
