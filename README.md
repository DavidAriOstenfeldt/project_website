This is the repository for our final project in computational social science 2022: _Analysing Song Artists and Lyrics Through Genius_. 

The project was developed by:

| Name                   |  Student number |
|:-----------------------|----------------:|
|David Ari Ostenfeldt    |s194237          |
|Kristian Rhindal MÃ¸llman| s194246         |
|Kristoffer Marboe       |  s194249        |

We make use of several APIs to collect data:

- [billboard.py](https://github.com/guoguo12/billboard-charts) to get a list of songs from Billboards 'Hot-100' chart going all the way back to 1958.
- [LyricsGenius](https://lyricsgenius.readthedocs.io/en/master/) to collect song titles, artists, release date and lyrics for the songs.

The data set used in the project can be downloaded here:
