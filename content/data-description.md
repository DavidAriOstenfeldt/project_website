# Gathering the data
First, we got the songs we wanted to investigate from the [Billboard 'Hot-100' list](https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/). Here, we collected song titles and artist names of all songs that appeared on the list starting from the first week of 1960, all the way to today. This was done with the [billboard.py API](https://github.com/guoguo12/billboard-charts).

We used the songs from this list to limit our scope, as otherwise the amount of data we would have to download would be insurmountable. This of course means that the data set does not provide a full picture of the entire network and vocabulary of artists, but as the data is collected from the most popular songs each week, we believe it to be a sufficient representation of the general trends in artists and lyrics through the years. We used the list of artists and song titles to collect lyrics, release year, collaborations, genres and titles from [genius.com](https://genius.com/Rick-astley-never-gonna-give-you-up-lyrics). This was done via two APIs:  and the [LyricsGenius API](https://lyricsgenius.readthedocs.io/en/master/).
