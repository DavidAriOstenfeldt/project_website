The lyrics retrieved from Genius.com provide a rich look into the language which has been used in mainstream music throughout the last sixty years. There is a lot to analyse which is why the page is divided into 3 separate sections. The first section goes over differences and similarities between genres. Next comes a section exposing the trends of each decade, and lastly, the reader is invited on a deep dive into the linguistic proficiency of the most successful artist in modern times.

# artists

Goal: Summary statistics should be needly confined for each artist letting the reader click on the desired artist.

Summary statistics include:

> Wordcloud, sentiment (compared to dist), songs on top 100, top n most similar and dissimilar artists

Note: artist clouds may not be indicative of the average word usage by an artist. The wordclouds are most likely _skewed_ towards what is mainstream. It is far from all songs by an artist which reach top 100.
