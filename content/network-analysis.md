This section will cover the collaboration between artists aspect of the project. For this we will make use of different network theories and constructions in order to analyse the properties between artists. Specifically, we will go through how the full network of all artists were created and investigate it using various networks science analysis strategies. In addition to the network of all artists, we've also created smaller networks for specific genres. All this, and more, can be seen at the bottom of the page.

# Creating the network
The network is created by making each artist into a node and link up two artists if they have collaborated on a song. The size of a node is determined by the number of times they have appeared on Billboard's the hot 100 chart and the colour is based upon the most common genre for that artist. The size of each link is determined by the number of times the two artists have collaborated.


# Walk-through of the full network
## Statistics, degree distribution
Having created the full network, we are now ready to analyse it to get a better understanding of the artist's colaboratory dynamics. The two simplest measures are the number of nodes and links in the graph.

\begin{equation*}
    \textrm{Number of nodes}: 7845 \qquad \textrm{Number of links}: 6799
\end{equation*}
